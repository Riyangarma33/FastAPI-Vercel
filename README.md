# FastAPI-Vercel

A Hello World FastAPI app that deployed to Vercel using CI/CD.

Warning! According to [Vercel Python Documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/python), Vercel only support Python 3.9, Python 3.6 already deprecated. I recommend to use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) in order to set Python version in custom environment.
